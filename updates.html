    <h1>6/20/2021 (20/6/2021) Version 1.1.2-alpha</h1>
    <p>Sorry for this late release. But I am adding some new pages (not finished yet). Also I am redecorating and fixing bugs.</p>
    <h1>About/More 20 days ago: Version 1.1.1-alpha</h1>
    <p>Some bugs have been fixed but there are a few bugs that need to be fixed. I am working on a contact form but I am not too sure if that will be released soon since I am the only one programming. But I am making the contact form and added some features to it.</p>
