            <h1>KitPVP information</h1>
            <p>KitPVP is a Minecraft minigame that lots of servers use for other players to battle each other</p>
            <p>If you die in kitpvp, it doesn't mean that you are out of the game, you will respawn and you can get back in the battlefield.</p>
            <p>KitPVP isn't just regular pvp, no. KitPVP comes with different types of classes that you can use to battle other players in different ways.</p>
            <p>This kitpvp arena was built by Jind</p>
            <p>Here's how you start in kitpvp. Fall from spawn down to the battlefield. When you fall, you will not take any fall damage.</p>
            <div id="tips">
                <h1>Some useful tips</h1>
                <p>Watch out for players with a more powerful class than yours. If you have a class with full iron, don't try to take on a player with full diamond unless you are a PVP expert.</p>
