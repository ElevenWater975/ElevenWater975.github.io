        <p>Welcome to <strong>Space of Improvement</strong>! Here, you will find a lot of things based on self-improvement and other stuff. Please note that this website is stil in Alpha and has some bugs. If you do find a bug, it is best to come to this page or contact me at nje.eleven34@outlook.com. That's all I have to say for this introduction.</p>

        <h2>How often is the site worked on.</h2>
        <p>As the owner of this website, I am working on this website <strong class="a28de">almost daily</strong>. I hopefully can come up with more ideas to add on to this website. New pages like this are being worked on very very frequently. I check up on this site every day.</p>

        <h2>What do I do if I encounter a style error?</h2>
        <p>If you encounter a style error (in my definiton something that doesn't look right, is not aligned properly, or in other words looks like it shouldn't), please report what you're talking about to my <a href="mailto:nje.eleven34@outlook.com">email</a> and tell me which page you are talking about and the style error. I did notice some errors I made in styling elements in CSS and I am trying to fix that. If you report a mobile style error, please notice that I am aware that the site looks terrible on mobile because the site is not mobile compatible. You may find multiple style errors and if you do, please report all of them to me. As said before, I am working on this site almost daily.</p>
