            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Meditation is a good and relaxing way to improve your mental health. You don't have to do some crazy
                stereotypical meditation ritual (no disrespect to anyone who does this), just close your eyes (or focus
                on something) and breathe. Focus on your breath for just 3 - 5 minutes for starters. In this article,
                you will read about meditation and it's health benefits. Enjoy your reading.</p>

        <div class="container second-paragraph">
            <h2>Mental health benefits</h2>
            <p>Have you been feeling down lately? Have you been thinking of negative thoughts? You should try to
                meditate and journal about these thoughts. No matter how normal feeling down or feeling stressed may be,
                it is not okay to stay like this. Meditation can actually reduce negative thoughts and stress.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container third-paragraph">
            <p>According to <a
                    href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/meditation/how-meditation-can-improve-your-mental-health/" target="_blank">this
                    article</a>, studies have shown that meditation can reduce stress and negative thoughts. Meditation
                can also help with depression. According to <a
                    href="https://www.healthline.com/health/meditation-for-depression#benefits" target="_blank">healthline</a>,
                meditation makes depression more manageable and would help change your response to negative thinking.
                The dark thoughts that depression has brought you made you react to them negatively. However, practicing
                mindful meditation will just help you notice the negative thoughts, and let them go so you wont respond
                to the negative thought in a negative way.</p>

        <h2>How do I start meditating?</h2>
        <div class="container fourth-paragraph">
            <p>What I recommend is that you listen to meditation sessions on a mobile app or through a youtube audio
                session. I don't recommend any other app but Medito (I am not sponsored). I first saw this app called
                Medito from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Hamza97" target="_blank">Hamza</a> and I downloaded it. Medito has a
                daily meditation you can listen to which is a guided session, a timer for unguided sessions, and
                multiple courses including a 30 day challenge. When you click on the daily meditation, you can choose
                who to listen to and for how long. I recommend you listen to them for 3 or 5 minutes if you are a
                beginner.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>How often should I meditate?</h2>
        <div class="fifth-paragraph">
            <p>Ideally, you should meditate every single day for at least 3 minutes. But you should start being consistent with it. Try to go 2 weeks with 5 minutes daily meditation (guided). After 2 weeks, you should see some improvement. Always journal how you feel after the meditation and delay gratification to get a good mental health boost.</p>
