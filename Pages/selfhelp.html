            <p>So you probably already know me but if you dont, my name is Eleven (Not my real name). I am a 15-year-old
                on self improvement and I will always be a lifelong student whether I have made a lot of progress or
                not. I want <strong class="ta1">you</strong> to join me on this wonderful journey. I made this page to
                spread the word of self-improvement to as many young men as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h1>My self-improvement journey</h1>
        <p class="para2">I first started being a student on self improvement since <strong>December 2021</strong>. I
            decided that it was time for me to be the best version of myself. I urge <strong id="all">all young
                men</strong> to join me on this journey of self-improvement. Together, we will develop our lives, we
            will become the greatest version of ourselves, and we will never stop. Click on <a
                style="text-decoration: none; color: lightblue;" href="https://discord.gg/Y7kByEfMYK">this link</a> to
            join the a self-improvement server that I made called Space of Improvement so you can meet more people who
            are on self-improvement.</p>
        <img src="../img/download (13).jpeg">
        <caption>A good depiction of most young men today.</caption>
        <p class="para3">I believe that every young men should be on self-improvement. We are the most submissive out of
            our entire bloodline and we don't want that. We want to be stronger and we want to be more masculine. If we
            don't learn to be more masculine, then how would are future kids be? Would our future kids be more feminine
            than we are? The choices you make affect your future.</p>

        <div id="fitness">
            <h1>Fitness</h1>
            <p class="para4">I believe that physical fitness is important for everyones health. Fitness helps you live
                longer and helps you be more healthy. I started going to the gym over a year ago when the gyms opened
                up, but I also work out at home, the gyms are not the only place you should work out. I have been
                getting more consistent on my workouts. I have been setting a few goals (one of them is to lose a lot of
                weight) and I want you to as well. Click off this website right now and write down some goals on a piece
                of paper and when you're done, come back to this website.</p>
            <img style="width: 825px;" src="../img/fitness-pose-workout-gym-524.jpg">
            <caption>This is not me</caption>
            <p class="para5">When you think about what you are going to do for fitness, don't just think about your
                goals, think of the process on how you're going to achieve those goals. If you just think about your
                goals, you are probably not going to make much progress. But if you think about the process, you are
                probably going to make more progress. Never give up on your goals and think about your process. Good
                luck on your fitness journey.</p>

        <div id="meditation">
            <h1>Meditation</h1>
            <p class="para6">Meditation is important for everyone's mental health. Meditation is supposed to make you
                more mindful. I believe that <strong>everyone</strong> should practice meditation. To start meditating,
                I recommend you download the app "Medito" on your phone. After that, do daily meditation for 3 minutes
                (I usually do 5 minutes). This is good for your mental health.</p>

            <p>You may not like how this topic starts.</p>
            <p class="para7">We live in a world where people are addicted to porn and jacking off, especially teenagers.
                Most teenagers today can't go over a week without fapping and this is not a good thing. They are
                willingly overstimulating themselves with false pleasure. PMO (Porn, Masturbation, Orgasm) is very very
                addictive and I urge every young man to try to stop fapping. Everytime you do the PMO activities, you
                are making yourself weaker and weaker. I will elaborate on this topic on other pages.</p>
