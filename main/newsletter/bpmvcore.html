            <p>Due to a problem found in the plugin, we had to disable multiverse-core from BlockPro</p>

                <p>This means that players are not able to teleport to other minigame worlds. This means that some minigames have to be disabled</p>

                <h2>Is this change permanent?</h2>
                <p>No this is a temporary change. Me and the other Administators will decide when it is ok to add Multiverse-core back into the server.</p>

                <h2>Why is Multiverse-core disabled?</h2>
                <p>Multiverse-core is temporarily disabled from BlockPro due to an exploit that was spotted by one of our staff members. 
                    This exploit caused players to have the ability to crash the server.
